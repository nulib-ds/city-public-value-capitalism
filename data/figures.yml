    alt: "This figure is a circular flow chart that demonstrates the relationship between indicators of individual well-being and the different types of capital needed to sustain this well-being over time. The individual indicators are in two categories, quality of life and material living conditions, and draw on the OECD's Better Life Index. This figure includes an overlay that indicates the traditional measures of progress like gross domestic product (GDP)."

    alt: "This figure outlines five strategies, or city-concepts, that shrinking cities can adopt to respond to their contextual challenges. First, a compact city maintains the vitality of the city and reduces administrative costs by concentrating citizens in the center as the population declines. Second, a smart city makes use of Information Technology to make up for shrinking population and economy. Third, an ecological city utilizes and regenerates the excellent natural environment to improve the quality of residential and industrial spaces. Fourth, an inclusive city is one in which citizens can coexist as equals regardless of nationality, gender, age, religion, etc. Five, a restorative city that restores dropped-out to pursue the happiness of each and every citizen as a community."

      This figure depicts the ways in which information and communications technology can create value for cities across the following categories: energy, water, waste; financial services; autonomous transportation and delivery; education and e-learning; health, medicine, and nursing; safety and security; and disaster prevention.

      The figure illustrates the definition and evaluation methods of zero energy buildings. Increased volume of energy supply (along the vertical axis) can be accomplished through the introduction of renewable energy, while decreased volume of energy consumption (along the horizontal axis) can be accomplished through load reduction, use of natural energy, and improved efficiency of equipment systems. This combination of energy saving processes and increasing renewable energy, helps illustrate the differing definitions of "ZEB Ready," "Nearly ZEB," and "ZEB" towards zero energy consumption.
